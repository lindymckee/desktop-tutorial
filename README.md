Hagfish transcriptomics

We are trying to identify genes that are differentially expressed among skin, slime gland, and barbel tissues in the Atlantic Hagfish (Myxine glutinosa). Our project includes four major steps:
1) Assemble transcriptome
2) Map reads to transcriptome
3) Measure gene expression based on read coverage
4) Identify the genes that are differentially expressed

Step 1: Assemble transcriptome
Transcriptome was assembled using Trinity. Forward reads were concatenated to one file from forward reads from a skin, slime gland, and barbel sample. We also concatenated backward reads from each sample.

Step 2: Map reads to transcriptome
Paired-end reads from 4 barbel samples, 3 skin samples, and 3 slime gland samples will be mapped onto the transcriptome using Salmon.

Step 3: Measure gene expression based on read coverage
TBD

Step 4: Identify the genes that are differentially expressed
BLAST search of nucleotide sequences identified in step 3
